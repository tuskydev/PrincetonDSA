# Princeton Data Structures and Algorithms Course Solo Project

### A repo for the DSA course from Princeton University! Documenting fundamental concepts, advanced algorithms, and their implementations in Java.


### Things learned:
* Gain insights into the implementation of classic algorithms
* Fundamentals: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
* Code < Algorithms! (If used properly it can be the best thing about your program)

### Overall, a productive project which allowed for better understanding of Algorithms and truly stretched my legs with Java on this course

## KEY NOTES: ONLYADDIFYOUNEEDDISCLAIMERS!!!
* The first Carousel was made with Bootstrap NPM 
* The second Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Class` Component 
* The third Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Function` Component 

## Steps to recreate:

### In console:
`
npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
`

`
npm i react-alice-carousel
`

### Add these lines to the App.js file:
```
import {
  Checkbox,
  Sidebar,
} from 'semantic-ui-react';
import AliceCarousel from 'react-alice-carousel';

import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';
import 'react-alice-carousel/lib/alice-carousel.css';
```
