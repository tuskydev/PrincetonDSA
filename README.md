# Princeton Data Structures and Algorithms Course Solo Project

### A repo for the DSA course from Princeton University! Documenting fundamental concepts, advanced algorithms, and their implementations in Java.

### Things learned:

- Gain insights into the implementation of classic algorithms
- Fundamentals: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Code < Algorithms! (If used properly it can be the best thing about your program)

### Overall, a productive project which allowed better understanding of Algorithms and truly stretched my legs with Java on this course

## Preview of work done:

### Challenges arose! Percolation was one of them:

## Key notes:

- You must run the following commands if you want to create the environment for Java files to run in the terminal!

### In terminal:

`javac -cp algs4.jar [insert file name you wish to run in terminal]`

`java -cp algs4.jar [insert file name you wish to run in terminal]`

### Add these lines to the ANYJAVAFILE.java file:

```
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdRandom;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdStats;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.WeightedQuickUnionUF;
```

### Choose any example code from the Docs here and adjust to the best fit.
